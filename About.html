            <td align="left" valign="top" class="text1">In the year 710, the first permanent Japanese capital was
                established in Nara, a city modelled after the Chinese capital. Large Buddhist monasteries were built in
                the new capital. The monasteries quickly gained such strong political influence that, in order to
                protect the position of the emperor and central government, the capital was moved to Nagaoka in 784, and
                finally to Heian (Kyoto) in 794 where it would remain for over one thousand years.

                One characteristic of the Nara and Heian periods is a gradual decline of Chinese influence which,
                nevertheless, remained strong. Many of the imported ideas were gradually "Japanized". In order to meet
                particular Japanese needs, several governmental offices were established in addition to the government
                system which was copied after the Chinese model, for example. In the arts too, native Japanese movements
                became increasingly popular. The development of the Kana syllables made the creation of actual Japanese
                literature possible. Several new Buddhist sects that were imported from China during the Heian period,
                were also "Japanized".</td>

                <p>In 1185, the Minamoto family took over the control over Japan after defeating the Taira clan in the
                    Gempei war. Minamoto Yoritomo established a new military government, the Kamakura Bakufu, in
                    Kamakura and was appointed shogun in the year 1192.

                    After Yoritomo's death in 1199, quarrels for supremacy started between the Kamakura Bakufu and the
                    Imperial court in Kyoto. Those quarrels for supremacy found an end in the Jokyu disturbance in 1221
                    when Kamakura defeated the Imperial army in Kyoto, and the Hojo regents in Kamakura achieved
                    complete control over Japan. By redistributing the land gained during the Jokyu disturbance, they
                    were able to achieve loyalty among all the powerful people throughout the country. The emperor and
                    the remaining governmental offices in Kyoto lost practically all effective power.</p>

                <p class="text4">The emperor Go-Daigo was able to restore imperial power in Kyoto and to overthrow the
                    Kamakura Bakufu in 1333. However, the revival of the old imperial offices under the Kemmu
                    restoration (1334) did not last for long because the old administration system was out of date and
                    practice, and incompetent officials failed gaining the support of the powerful landowners.

                    Ashikaga Takauji, once fighting for the emperor, now challenged the imperial court and succeeded in
                    capturing Kyoto in 1336. Go-Daigo, consequently, fled to Yoshino in the South of Kyoto where he
                    founded the Southern court. At the same time, another emperor was appointed in Kyoto. This was
                    possible because of a succession dispute that had been going on between two lines of the imperial
                    family since the death of emperor Go-Saga in 1272.</p>
